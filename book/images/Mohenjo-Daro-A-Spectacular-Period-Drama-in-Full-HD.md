The film is not only a love story, but also a tribute to the ancient civilization of Mohenjo-daro, which was one of the most advanced and sophisticated societies of its time. The film depicts the culture, architecture, art, and religion of the people who lived in the city, as well as the challenges they faced from natural disasters and foreign invaders. The film also explores the themes of identity, destiny, and freedom.
 
However, the film is not without its flaws. The film has been criticized for its historical inaccuracies, such as the use of anachronistic costumes, weapons, and languages. The film also suffers from a weak script, poor editing, and uneven pacing. The film is too long and repetitive, with many unnecessary scenes and songs that drag the narrative. The film also fails to create a convincing chemistry between the lead actors, who are overshadowed by the veteran supporting cast.
 
Mohenjo Daro is a film that tries to be an epic historical drama, but ends up being a mediocre and disappointing affair. The film has some redeeming qualities, such as the performance of Hrithik Roshan, the music of A.R. Rahman, and some impressive action sequences. But these are not enough to save the film from its many shortcomings. Mohenjo Daro is a film that could have been much better, but instead falls short of its potential.
