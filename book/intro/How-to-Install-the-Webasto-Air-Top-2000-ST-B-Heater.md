1. Choose a suitable location for the heater. The heater should be installed in a clean, dry and well-ventilated area that is protected from water, dirt and heat sources. The heater should also be accessible for maintenance and repair. The heater can be mounted either horizontally or vertically, but not upside down.
2. Install the mounting bracket and secure the heater to it with four screws. Make sure the heater is firmly attached and does not vibrate or move.
3. Connect the fuel supply line to the heater. The fuel supply line should be routed from the vehicle's fuel tank to the heater's fuel pump and then to the heater's fuel inlet. The fuel line should be secured with clamps and protected from abrasion, heat and sharp edges. The fuel pump should be mounted below the level of the fuel tank and as close as possible to the heater.
4. Connect the electrical wiring to the heater. The electrical wiring should be routed from the vehicle's battery to the heater's control unit and then to the heater's power connector. The wiring should be secured with cable ties and protected from abrasion, heat and sharp edges. The wiring should also be fused according to the specifications in the installation manual.
5. Connect the combustion air intake pipe to the heater. The combustion air intake pipe should be routed from a clean and fresh air source to the heater's air intake connector. The pipe should be secured with clamps and protected from water, dirt and heat sources.
6. Connect the exhaust pipe to the heater. The exhaust pipe should be routed from the heater's exhaust connector to a safe outlet point outside the vehicle. The pipe should be secured with clamps and protected from water, dirt and heat sources. The pipe should also be fitted with a silencer to reduce noise.
7. Connect the hot air outlet ducting to the heater. The hot air outlet ducting should be routed from the heater's air outlet connector to one or more vents inside the vehicle. The ducting should be secured with clamps and protected from water, dirt and heat sources. The ducting should also be insulated to prevent heat loss.
8. Test the heater for proper operation. Before using the heater for the first time, you need to check for leaks, loose connections, correct polarity, proper voltage, adequate ventilation and error codes. You also need to run the heater for at least 15 minutes to burn off any residues from manufacturing.
